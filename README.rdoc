= About

Backuper is a simple server backup tool written in Ruby. It is aimed to backup a Rails application (file assets and database) to a remote SSH verser (using rsync).

= Installation

  sudo gem install backuper

= Configuration

Configure and run the backup :

  Backuper.new do
	  set :source_path,             '/var/apps/blop/current/shared/system'
	  set :local_backup_base_path,  '/var/backups/blop'
	  set :remote_backup_ssh_info,  'username@host:/path/to/backups/blop'
	  set :max_kept_backups,        30
	  set :mysql_params,            YAML::load(File.read('config/database.yml'))['development']
	end
	
Put this in a script (e.g., *app/backup.rb*).

= Scheduling

A a line to your crontab with *crontab -e* to run the script.

Or use whenever :

  every 12.hours do
    backup_profile 'my_profile'
  end
