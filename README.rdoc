= About

Backuper is a simple server backup tool written in Ruby. It is aimed to backup a Rails application (file assets and database) to a remote SSH server (using rsync).

= Installation

  sudo gem install backuper

= Configuration

Configure and run the backup :

  Backuper.new do
    set :source_path,             '/var/apps/blop/current/shared/system'
    set :local_backup_base_path,  '/var/backups/blop'
    set :remote_backup_ssh_info,  'username@host:/path/to/backups/blop'
    set :max_kept_backups,        30
    set :mysql_params,            YAML::load(File.read('config/database.yml'))['production']
  end

No trailing slashes anywhere. The path in *remote_backup_ssh_info* must be the parent directory where different backups are stored (other applications).
	
Put this in a script (e.g., *script/backup.rb*) and make it executable (*chmod +x*).

Don't forget to set up the public keys, it won't work with password authentication.

= Scheduling

Add a line to your crontab with *crontab -e* to run the script.

Or use whenever with in your *config/schedule.rb* :

  every 1.day, :at => '4am' do
	  command "cd #{File.dirname(File.expand_path(__FILE__))} && ruby script/backup.rb"
	end
